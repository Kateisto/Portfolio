### About The Project
This was my first complete Unity game project which I started in early 2018. This project's main goal was to develop a functioning game which includes at least one fully playable level with a start and ending.

Textures, music and models in the project are not my productions, but all the code and mechanics I've designed and made myself. Hours used for the project are ~150h. There has been a huge improvement in Unity- and programming skills since the time of this project.

### Video
