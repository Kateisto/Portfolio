### About The Project
This was my first complete Unity game project which I started in early 2018. This projects main goal was to develope a functioning game which includes at least one level with a start and ending.

Textures, music and models in the project are not my productions, but all the code and mechanics I've designed and made myself. Hours used for the project are ~150h.

### Video
