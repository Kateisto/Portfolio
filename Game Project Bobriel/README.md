### About The Project
This the latest school project and there were 6 of us working on the project. The project was done from scratch with Unity3D. Target platform of the game was PC.

### The Concept
The concept idea was to create a fast-paced vertical platformer with strong emphasis on difficulty and speed.

### My Job
In the project I was working on concepting, game design, programming, test planning, testing and project management. I like to work on various different tasks, but programming is my passion and it was my main job in this project.
