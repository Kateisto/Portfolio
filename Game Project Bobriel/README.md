### About The Project
This is our current school project and there are 6 of us working on the project. The project is done from scratch with Unity3D and the programming language is C#. Target platform of the game is PC.

### The Concept
The concept idea is to create a fast-paced vertical platformer with strong emphasis on difficulty and speed.

### My Job
In the project I have been working on concepting, game design, programming, test planning, testing and project management. I like to work on various different tasks, but programming is my passion and it has also been my main job in this project.

### Video
In this short clip of our test level you can see the core mechanics of the game. Make sure to turn up the quality.
