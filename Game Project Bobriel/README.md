### About the project
This is our current school project and there is 6 of us working on the project. The project is done from scratch with Unity3D and the programming language is C#.

### The concept
The concept idea is to create a fast-paced vertical platformer with strong emphasis on difficulty and speed.

### My job
In the project I have been working on concepting, game design, programming, test planning, testing and project management. Most of the time in the project I've spent programming, which is my passion, but I also like to work on other tasks.
